/// Helper macro for defining test-scenarios.
///
/// The basic idea is to write test-cases and then observe the behavior of the
/// simulated network through the tracing mechanism for debugging purposes.
///
/// The macro defines a mini-language to easily express sequences of commands
/// which are executed concurrently unless you explicitly pass time between them.
/// The script needs some collection of channels to operate over which has to be
/// provided as the first command (see next section).
/// Commands are separated by semicolons and are either requests (open an
/// account, deposit money, withdraw money and transfer money between accounts)
/// or other commands (currently only sleep).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// The following script creates two accounts (Foo and Bar) in different branch
/// offices, deposits money in the Foo-account, waits a second, transfers it to
/// bar, waits another half second and withdraws the money. The waiting periods
/// are critical, because we need to give the consensus-protocol time to confirm
/// the sequence of transactions before referring to changes made in a different
/// branch office. Within one branch office the timing is not important since
/// the commands are always delivered in sequence.
///
/// ```rust
///     let channels: Vec<Channel<_>>;
///     script! {
///         use channels;
///         [0] "Foo" => open(), deposit(10);
///         [1] "Bar" => open();
///         sleep();   // the argument defaults to 1 second
///         [0] "Foo" => transfer("Bar", 10);
///         sleep(0.5);// may also sleep for fractions of a second
///         [1] "Bar" => withdraw(10);
///     }
/// ```
